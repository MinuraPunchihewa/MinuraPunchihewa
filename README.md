Hello World ðŸ‘‹,

I'm halfway between a Software Engineer and a Data Engineer. While I love messing around with big datasets, nothing beats the thrill of creating something people find useful. One thing is for certain thoughâ€”I love open source! Each contribution I make is my way of leaving a mark on the world.
